1. How many degrees of freedom does each joint have?
Ans. Wrist: 2 
     Thumb cmc: 2
     Thumb mcp: 2
     Thumb ip: 1
     mcp of index, middle, ring and pinky fingers: 2
     pip of index, middle, ring and pinky fingers: 1
     dip of index, middle, ring and pinky fingers: 1
2. Is there a way to compute the rotation matrices for each joint from their joint angles?
Ans. DH parameters can be used to compute the rotation matrices of each joint and express the location of the tip of each finger with respect to the base coordinate frame
3. How do we compute the length of each bone of the hand?
Ans. Assuming that the camera is stationary, measure the height of an object in reality and compute the pixel height of the same object in a photograph taken by the camera. Calculate the ratio between the real object height and the pixel height. 
Now, choose the corresponding vector of the bone, calculate the pixel distance of the entire vector and multiply it with the above ratio to get the bone length
